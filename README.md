# Project_Sales-Forecasting-and-Optimization_Team4
🛍️ Project Overview: Sales Forecasting and Optimization
This project focuses on predicting retail product sales and optimizing inventory management using machine learning. It includes a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to input various farm and product details to forecast:

Quantity of products sold (in liters or kilograms)

Approximate total revenue (in INR)

🔍 What the Project Does
The application uses a trained machine learning model to make accurate predictions based on inputs like:

Total land area and number of cows

Farm size category (Small, Medium, Large)

Product information such as ID, price, and stock levels

These predictions help farmers and retail managers:

Make better inventory decisions

Avoid under- or over-stocking

Maximize revenue with data-driven insights

🧠 Tech Stack
Python

Streamlit for the interactive web app

scikit-learn / joblib for machine learning model deployment

Pandas for data handling

🚀 Key Features
Intuitive form-based UI for entering farm and product data

Dynamic prediction of both quantity sold and revenue

Smart use of ML to drive inventory optimization
